# About Me
Name : Kabir Dhruw

Hello! Humans are the most superior creatures amid all the creatures in the entire universe. 
Being a part of this universe makes me feel small and minuscule in a world where there millions of humans like myself. 
Although everyone is quite unique in their own way. I try my best to be humble, kind and respectful to everybody I meet
regardless of their age, gender, family background, nationality or race. It is not an easy task to write about oneâ€™s self 
because one may tend to either over exaggerate or fail to give succinct descriptions and commendations where necessary. 
It is with this background that I introduce myself.

I am Kabir Dhruw and I live in Kharagpur, West Bengal. I love to travel and meet new people. I am an outgoing person and I love to have fun.
My live centers on improving humanity and I love where I am at right now.
